 \\Adding flexbox to website
        a. <div class ="my-flex-container"> 
            <h1> My Header </h1>
            <p> My Paragraph </p>
            </div>
            
        everything within this div follow the flexbox rules 
        
        display : flex - what switches on Flexbox and will align things horizontally 
        flex-direction : column - row lines the content up horizontally
                                  column stacks the content vertically  
                      
        justify-content : center   determines how the content is aligned on the page. 
                                   center aligns the entire container in the middle of the web page
